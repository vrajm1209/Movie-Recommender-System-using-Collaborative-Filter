# Movie-Recommender-System-using-Collaborative-Filter

Movie Recommender System are widely used on streaming platforms like Netflix etc. Not only for movies, but recommendor systems are also used in recommending products to users on Amazon and such platforms. Even music recommendations are a part of our daily life. Recommendor systems are widespread and a part of our lives.

I implement a simple movie recommendor system in this notebook. I use the Item-based Collaborative Filter approach in this. The dataset used can be found at https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/
